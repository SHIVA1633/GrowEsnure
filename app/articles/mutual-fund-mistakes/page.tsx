          <p>
            Picture this: You're at a family gathering, and your cousin can't stop bragging about the 40% returns he got
            from a small-cap fund last year. Excited, you rush to invest in the same fund, only to see it plummet 30%
            over the next six months. Sound familiar?
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Here's what's really happening: By the time a fund becomes the talk of the town, its best performance is
            often behind it. The market is cyclical, and what goes up must come down. Professional fund managers know
            this, which is why they focus on:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
            <li>Consistent performers rather than one-hit wonders</li>
            <li>Funds that perform well in both bull and bear markets</li>
            <li>Risk-adjusted returns, not just raw percentages</li>
          </ul>

            2. The "Set It and Forget It" Blunder: Neglecting Your Portfolio
          </h3>
          <p>
            Let's be honest: How often do you actually look at your mutual fund portfolio? Once a year? Maybe when
            you're filing taxes? You're not alone. Many investors treat their mutual funds like a slow cooker – set it
            and forget it.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            But here's the harsh truth: The financial world is constantly changing. That balanced fund you bought five
            years ago might now be heavily skewed towards debt when you need equity exposure, or vice versa.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Consider this scenario: An IT professional invests in an aggressive small-cap fund at age 30. Five years
            later, they're married with a child on the way. Their risk tolerance has changed, but their portfolio
            hasn't. They're now exposing themselves to unnecessary risk that could jeopardize their family's financial
            security.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. The "More is Better" Myth: Over-Diversification Paralysis</h3>
          <p>
            You've heard that diversification is good, so you've invested in 20 different mutual funds. You feel safe,
            but in reality, you've just created a very expensive index fund.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">Here's what your portfolio probably looks like:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
            <li>5 large-cap funds that all own the same top 20 stocks</li>
            <li>3 mid-cap funds with significant overlap</li>
            <li>4 balanced funds that are essentially doing the same thing</li>
            <li>A couple of sector funds you bought because they were "hot" at the time</li>
            <li>Some random debt funds you don't really understand</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The result? You're paying higher expense ratios for redundant investments, and your returns are likely
            trailing a simple index fund. It's like ordering every dish on the menu instead of a well-balanced meal.

      <h2>The Hidden Costs of These Mistakes: A Real-Life Scenario</h2>
      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
        <p>
          Meet Priya, a 28-year-old marketing executive who started investing ₹10,000 monthly in mutual funds five years
          ago. She picked funds based on recent performance and recommendations from friends. Here's how her
          well-intentioned but misguided strategy played out:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>Year 1-2: Great returns of 15% p.a. as she caught the tail end of a bull run</li>
          <li>Year 3: Market correction hit her portfolio hard, losing 20%</li>
          <li>Year 4-5: Recovered slowly, averaging 8% p.a.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Overall 5-year return: About 7% p.a. Sounds okay, right? But here's the kicker: A well-managed, professionally
          advised portfolio could have yielded 12% p.a. over the same period.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 font-semibold">
          The cost of her mistakes: Over ₹2 lakhs in lost returns, and that's just in 5 years. Imagine the impact over
          25-30 years of your investment journey!
