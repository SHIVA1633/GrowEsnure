      <h2>Understanding HUF: A Unique Indian Tax Entity</h2>
      <p>
        Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is a separate entity recognized under the Indian Income Tax Act, offering
        significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities for Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist families.

          <h3 className="font-semibold">What is an HUF?</h3>
          <p>
            An HUF consists of all lineal descendants of a common ancestor, including their wives and unmarried
            daughters. It's a separate legal entity for tax purposes, with its own PAN card and the ability to invest,
            earn, and file taxes independently from its members.

          <h3 className="font-semibold">The Karta: Key Decision Maker</h3>
          <p>
            The Karta, typically the eldest male member, manages the HUF. They have the authority to make financial
            decisions on behalf of the HUF, including investments and asset management.

            HUF can own various assets including property, investments, and businesses. These assets and their income
            are treated separately from the individual income of HUF members.
