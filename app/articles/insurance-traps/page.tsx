        The Hidden Dangers of Traditional Life Insurance: Are You Falling into These Costly Traps?
      </h1>

      <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <p className="text-red-800 font-semibold">
          Alert: 78% of insurance policies sold in India are traditional plans or ULIPs. These products often fail to
          meet your financial goals. Here's why you need to pay attention.

      <h2>The Great Insurance Illusion</h2>
      <p>
        Every year, millions of hardworking professionals unknowingly invest in insurance products that silently erode
        their wealth. Let's uncover why these products are failing you:
      </p>

      <div className="grid gap-6 my-8">
        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">1. The Illusion of Returns</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional life insurance policies typically offer returns of 4-6% per annum. Sounds decent, right? Wrong.
            When you factor in inflation (averaging 6-7% annually), your money is actually losing value over time. It's
            like running on a treadmill – lots of effort, but you're not getting anywhere financially.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">2. The Commission Trap</h3>
          <p>
            Ever wonder why your agent is so pushy about certain policies? Here's a shocking fact: Agents can earn
            commissions as high as 35% in the first year on some products. Your hard-earned money is primarily funding
            their income, not your future.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">3. The Complexity Maze</h3>
          <p>
            Hidden clauses, complicated surrender charges, and unclear benefit illustrations – it's a labyrinth designed
            to confuse you. By the time you realize you're in the wrong product, exiting becomes prohibitively
            expensive.

        <li>Emotional manipulation: Agents exploit your fears about your children's future or retirement</li>
        <li>The "investment with protection" myth: The idea that one product can solve all financial needs</li>

        <li>Complexity as a sales tactic: When you can't compare, you can't make an informed decision</li>
        <li>The guarantee trap: "Guaranteed" returns seem attractive, but they often guarantee underperformance</li>
