        <p className="text-red-800 font-semibold">
          Urgent Warning: 65% of health insurance claims face initial rejection. Don't let your family become a

      <h2>The Silent Killers of Financial Health: Common Insurance Missteps</h2>

      <div className="grid gap-6 my-8">
        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">1. The Underinsurance Epidemic</h3>
          <p>Think you're covered? Think again. Most Indians are severely underinsured:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Average policy cover: A mere ₹3-5 lakhs</li>
            <li>Reality check: You need at least ₹10-20 lakhs per family</li>
            <li>The silent threat: Medical inflation is skyrocketing at 15-20% annually</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Imagine facing a ₹15 lakh hospital bill with just ₹5 lakhs of coverage. The financial aftermath could be
            devastating.

        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">2. The Corporate Coverage Mirage</h3>
          <p>Relying solely on your employer's insurance? You're walking on thin ice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Job change? Your coverage vanishes instantly</li>
            <li>Family needs often exceed basic corporate plans</li>
            <li>No coverage during job transitions – when you might need it most</li>
            <li>Pre-existing conditions become a nightmare when switching to personal policies</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">3. The Fine Print Fiasco</h3>
          <p>Not reading policy terms is like signing a blank check. Critical aspects often overlooked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Room rent sub-limits that can slash your claim by 50% or more</li>
            <li>Disease-wise capping leaving you exposed for certain treatments</li>
            <li>Waiting periods that can deny coverage when you need it most</li>
            <li>Network hospital restrictions forcing you to pay out-of-pocket</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>The Hidden Clauses That Turn Claims into Nightmares</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-existing disease definitions: A minor undisclosed condition can void your entire claim</li>
        <li>Proportionate deductions: How a slightly more expensive room can halve your claim amount</li>
        <li>Excluded treatments: Common procedures that your policy might not cover</li>
        <li>Co-payment clauses: When you're forced to pay a percentage, no matter how large the bill</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The True Cost of Inadequate Health Insurance: Beyond Just Money</h2>
      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8 shadow-md">
        <h3 className="font-semibold">The Ripple Effect on Your Life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Depleted savings that set you back years financially</li>
          <li>High-interest loans that can trap you in debt for decades</li>
          <li>Compromised treatment quality due to financial constraints</li>
          <li>Stress and anxiety affecting your recovery and family well-being</li>
