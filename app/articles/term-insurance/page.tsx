          Critical Information: 94% of Indian families are dangerously underinsured. Is your family at risk?

      <h2>The Harsh Reality of Financial Protection in India</h2>
      <p>
        In a country where the average household saves diligently for the future, there's a glaring gap in financial
        planning that puts millions of families at risk. Term insurance, the most efficient and affordable form of life
        insurance, remains largely misunderstood and underutilized.

          <h3 className="font-semibold">The Protection Gap</h3>
          <p>
            The average Indian household is insured for less than 10% of what they actually need. This means that in the
            event of an unexpected tragedy, most families are left with a fraction of the financial support required to
            maintain their lifestyle and achieve long-term goals.

        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">The Misconception of Cost</h3>
          <p>
            Many believe that adequate life insurance is expensive. In reality, term insurance offers substantial
            coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional policies. For instance, a 30-year-old non-smoking male can
            secure a 1 crore cover for as little as â‚¹700 per month.

        <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">The Illusion of Employer Coverage</h3>
          <p>
            Relying solely on employer-provided life insurance is a risky gamble. These policies often offer inadequate
            coverage and cease the moment you change jobs or retire, leaving you vulnerable precisely when you might
            need protection the most.
